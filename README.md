# MachineLearning
Implementations of different machine learning algorithms 

This project consists of jupyter notebooks with implementations of different machine learning algorithms from scratch or using python module.
Different datasets have been used along with the algorithms to perform predictions or inferences.

As on today the projects consists of:
1. KNN from scratch
2. Conformal predictor from scratch
3. Lasso
4. INductive conformal prediction and tests with Lasso
5. K Means on image
